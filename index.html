    <p>The fact that something is possible to measure, and may even be highly
    desirable and useful to expose to developers, does not meant that it can be
    exposed as runtime JavaScript API in the browser, due to various privacy
    and security constraints. The goal of this document is to explain why that
    is the case, and to provide guidance for what needs to be considered when
    making or evaluating a proposal for such API's.</p>
  </section>
  <section id='sotd'>
    <p>This is a <strong>work in progress</strong> and may change without any
    notices.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>**Performance is a feature.** Modern browsers provide extensive tooling
    to help developers understand and optimize their applications:
    network-layer insights about the requests (timing, cache, request and
    response payload, etc); rendering insights (cost of layout and style
    recalculations, image decoding, per-layer rendering costs, idle time, etc);
    CPU and memory profiling; JavaScript debugging, and much more. As a
    developer, you can open the "developer tools" console in any browser and
    get immediate access to a rich set of data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The data is offered with high-resolution: in real-time, with accurate
      timestamps, etc.</li>
      <li>The data is available for any origin, regardless of whether you own
      the site or not.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, experience shows that data gathered in this mode—by the
    developer, on their own "development" machine—is not sufficient. Real users
    run applications on a vast array of different hardware and under different
    conditions that are hard or impossible to replicate—and even anticipate—in
    the lab. Hence, <dfn data-lt="RUM">Real User Monitoring</dfn> (RUM), which
    provides a restricted subset of performance API's and metrics.</p>
    <p>Why restricted? Due to a number of privacy and security
    considerations:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The fact that a certain capability or metric can be recorded by the
      platform or browser, and may even be exposed in browser's developer
      tools, does not automatically mean that it should or can be exposed as a
      runtime API, because such data may reveal private or sensitive
      information about the visitor.</li>
      <li>API's and metrics that are exposed at runtime to the application
      (i.e. <a>RUM</a> API's) must take additional precautions against
      unintentionally exposing new or more accurate privacy and security
      attacks against the visitor:
        <ol>
          <li>Some API's and metrics may require additional opt-in
          mechanisms.</li>
          <li>Some API's and metrics may need to provide data at lower
          resolution - e.g. through reduced accuracy, aggregation, delayed or
          out-of-band delivery, etc.</li>
          <li>Some API's and metrics may not be possible to expose at all, even
          with above precautions in place.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>**In short, just because something is possible to measure, and perhaps
    is even highly desirable and useful to many developers, does not mean that
    it can be exposed as a runtime JavaScript API.** The goal of this document
    is to explain why that is the case, and to provide guidance for what needs
    to be considered when making or evaluating a proposal for such API's.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Types of profiling</h2>
    <section>
      <h2>Local ("DevTools") profiling</h2>
      <p>Whenever you open the developer tools console in the browser, or use
      other tools running on the same device to collect some form of a
      profiler, you are able to gather detailed traces about each and every
      sub-component of the system: everything from which JavaScript functions
      are executing, and all the way down to what each thread is doing in your
      favorite browser, what operations the OS and the underlying hardware is
      processing, and so on.</p>
      <p>Such profiling tools capture rich traces with a lot of data and are
      often invaluable in helping identify and resolve performance issues. The
      fact that the developer is able to observe this data about their own
      system does not expose new concerns from a privacy or security
      standpoint: the developer is collecting information about their own
      system; if <dfn data-lt="PII">personally identifiable information</dfn>
      (PII) is present in the trace (e.g. authentication or user data, etc)
      then it is their own.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The developer controls the device; the device contains developer's
        <a>PII</a>.
        </li>
        <li>The act of collecting a trace from own device, via whatever tool,
        is an implicit opt-in to gather a detailed report that may contain
        their private data.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="note">Developers should take precautions and scrub <a>PII</a>
      and other sensitive data if and when such tracing reports are shared with
      others, and especially in the public!</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Remote ("RUM") profiling</h2>
      <p>Understanding how the application performs on the end-user's device is
      critical to delivering a well functioning product. However, collecting
      such "real user measurement" data is a form of remote (<a>RUM</a>)
      profiling, which is subject to additional considerations:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Performance API's and metrics must follow the [same-origin security
        model][sop], which is a critical security mechanism for isolating web
        applications, and users data, from each other—e.g. cookies, navigation
        history, databases and so on.
          <p class="note">The above requirement is further complicated by the
          fact that the browser offers a number of shared caches that many
          performance-minded developers are understandably interested in (e.g.
          HTTP response cache, memory caches, etc), but that may be (ab)used in
          a side-channel attack and "leak" data about the user—e.g. timing of a
          response may reveal if the user has previously or recently visited
          another origin; the amount of time to execute some code, or paint
          some content, can reveal the users state; and so on.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The data contained on the device, belongs to the owner of the
        device—not the developer or the application owner—and likely contains
        private and sensitive information both about the owner, and other
        applications on their device. As a result, the browser cannot allow the
        same level of "deep profiling" access to the application by default, as
        that may reveal sensitive data about the user and other applications on
        the device.</li>
        <li>The API's and metrics that are exposed to the application must take
        precautions against enabling new or higher-resolution privacy and
        security attacks against the user.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In practice, and as a result of the above considerations, many
      <a>RUM</a> API's are limited in what they can expose to developers: some
      "deep profiling" use cases are simply not possible; some require reduced
      resolution; and some may surface that a performance problem exists but
      may not be able to expose why the problem is there.</p>
      <p>**We cannot and should not expect parity between local and remote
      profiling capabilities.**</p>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Privacy and Security considerations</h2>
    <section>
      <h2>Fingerprinting and security questionnaires</h2>
      <p>Review and consider the implications of the metric or API against the
      considerations in:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>[Fingerprinting Guidance for Web Specification
        Authors][fingerprinting]</li>
        <li>[Self-Review Questionnaire, Security and
        Privacy][sec-questionnaire]</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Same-origin security model</h2>
      <p>Ensure that the proposed API or metric conforms with the [same-origin
      security model][sop]: can the new API be used to reveal information about
      another origin? If so, it may need to be restricted, or disallowed.</p>
      <p>For example, Resource Timing API ([[RESOURCE-TIMING]]) provides high
      resolution timestamps for each resource fetch, but some resources are
      fetched from different origins and exposing high-resolution timestamps
      about such resources can leak data about the user's navigation history.
      To mitigate this, Resource Timing API defines the [`Timing-Allow-Origin`
      response header][tao], which acts as an opt-in mechanism that must be
      provided by the origin before such data is exposed to another origin.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Side-channel and timing attacks</h2>
      <p>Can the new API or metric be (ab)used to enable new or more accurate
      form of side-channel or timing attacks?</p>
      <p>For example, application developers may want to know precise
      information about renderer-related activities: if and when layout or
      style-recalc occurs, how long each frame took to render, if and when some
      content is painted, and so on. However, access to such high-resolution
      data could be (ab)used by an attacker to launch a number of
      high-resolution attacks against the user:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Explicit paint notifications can be used to [determine if the
        :visited link color has changed and a paint was triggered][visited]. An
        attacker could inject hundreds of iframes and rapidly iterate through a
        large list of URLs to infer user's navigation history.</li>
        <li>In absence of explicit notifications, the timing of how long a
        frame took to process can also reveal if a paint was triggered.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that some forms of above attacks are already possible today.
      However, the key is not whether it is simply possible, but whether the
      new API could enable higher resolution (more accurate, or much faster)
      form of attack.</p>
      <p>As a practical example, to address the above concerns the Frame Timing
      API ([[FRAME-TIMING]]) was specifically designed to surface slow-only
      frames—i.e. there are no explicit signals about paint, layout, or exact
      duration of the frame. As such, Frame Timing does not expose any attack
      capabilities beyond what is already possible with existing methods.</p>
      <p class="note">As a corollary to the above, <a>RUM</a> API's are limited
      in what they can expose with respect to the rendering pipeline. Proceed
      with caution in this space.</p>
      <p>As another example, application developers may want to know accurate
      memory usage of their applications, such that they can detect memory
      leaks and regressions in their code; adjust application logic at runtime,
      and so on.</p>
      <p>This is valuable data, but the same API could also be (ab)used to
      measure the memory footprint of third-party resources and dependencies,
      which can leak information about what content is being rendered—e.g. an
      attacker can figure out if the user is authenticated by comparing the
      memory footprint of the loaded iframe, which can vary based on whether
      the user gets presented with a login page vs authenticated content.</p>
      <p>One plausible mitigation to the above could be reduced accuracy of the
      reported used memory. Although, even there, it's not immediately clear
      what the minimum thresholds should be, and if such data is useful to
      developers once such a restriction is applied.</p>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Best practices for Performance API's</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>**Provide the minimum resolution to address the use case.**</p>
        <p>Real-time, high-resolution metrics enable higher accuracy attacks.
        Consider strategies to reduce resolution:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Round or bucket the provided metrics. For example,
          `DOMHighResolutionTimestamp` ([[HR-TIME]]) is [capped to 5
          microseconds][hr-time-resolution].</li>
          <li>Delay delivery of the metric, batch multiple metrics. Processing
          multiple metrics is more efficient and delayed delivery reduces
          accuracy and speed of many runtime attacks.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>**Avoid synchronous performance API's and metrics; use
        [`PerformanceObserver`][po].**</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Synchronous delivery and access can create performance
          bottlenecks.</li>
          <li>Asynchronous delivery can help slow down and mitigate some forms
          of attacks - see (1).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>**Require opt-in mechanisms where necessary.**</p>
        <p>It may be desirable to expose some forms of performance data about
        other origins that an application depends on. However, such data should
        only be made available with consent of those origins.</p>
        <p>For example, timing data about cross-origin resource fetches is
        subject to [`Timing-Allow-Origin`][tao] opt-in.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>**Protect origin-sensitive configuration and data.**</p>
        <p>Some use cases, such as error or policy violation reporting, require
        that changes in configuration of where and whether the report is
        delivered must be protected from other origins—e.g. if the page sets a
        security policy and wants to receive violation reports at a designated
        `report-uri`, then a third party script should not be able to modify
        this policy. In such cases, it may not be possible to expose a
        JavaScript API at all, and a different mechanism (e.g. HTTP headers)
        must be used.</p>
        <p class="note">For example, Network Error Logging
        ([[NETWORK-ERROR-LOGGING]]) intentionally does not expose a JavaScript
        API to configure where reports are delivered, as that may allow a
        malicious script to hijack and "hide" such failures.</p>
        <p>Some types of data should only be exposed to the origin, and should
        not be accessible to script.</p>
        <p class="note">For example, Network Error Logging reports are
        delivered via an out-of-band reporting API ([[REPORTING]]) mechanism to
        the endpoint designated by the origin. These reports are not exposed at
        runtime, as that could enable third party resources to enumerate them
        and acquire new and private information: past navigation history, IP of
        the user when navigation was initiated, and other sensitive
        information.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>**The API or metric exposes new, or more accurate, data that may
        have security and privacy implications. Does this mean we can't make it
        available to the web?**</p>
        <p>No. Runtime attacks are an ever-present and existing threat. The
        fact of their existence does not prevent us from making progress and
        exposing new and useful performance API's and metrics to web
        applications. However, we need to be careful and consider their
        implications on a case by case basis: outline the risks, consider
        possible mitigations, understand and clearly document the tradeoffs,
        and solicit wide review before proceeding with implementation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>**Can we use out-of-band reporting (OOBR) to mitigate above
        risks?**</p>
        <p>No. OOBR may be used as a mechanism to isolate some types of
        sensitive configuration and report data that belongs to the application
        origin from resources that belong to another origin and are executed by
        the application. However, the reverse is not true: simple use of OOBR
        does not grant privilege to the application to report arbitrary data or
        metrics that may reveal information about another origin, or the user,
        as that would violate both the user's privacy and the same-origin
        policy enforced by platform.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>**But I really need "deep" profiling, any other options?**</p>
        <p>Maybe. If you have administrative control of the user's device (e.g.
        via corporate policy), or can get the user to explicitly opt-in into a
        mode where they allow such profiling and reporting, you may be able to
        obtain higher-resolution profiling data. However, this is only
        applicable in select cases, and is generally discouraged, as it is
        virtually guaranteed to reveal a significant amount of private and
        sensitive data about the user.</p>
      </li>
